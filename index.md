## About me
My name is Snehal Ilawe. I am a final year Masters student in the Big Data Analytics program at San Diego State University with an GPA of 3.92. I currently work as Graduate Assistant with Dr Martina Musteen  at San Diego State University Research Foundation, analyzing data (using Python and Tableau) on cross-border acquisitions in 180 countries to gain deeper insights into the factors affecting the completion of such acquisition deals and discover unusual patterns and outliers that can highlight areas that need investigation. I am also working as Graduate Research Assistant in the Center for Climate and Sustainability Studies under Dr Samuel Shen to design and develop climatology plots to visualize trends and gain insights in historic climate data (https://4dvd.sdsu.edu/).

I also have 4 years of experience as a Software Developer at Amdocs, India. I have been part of numerous cross-functional team and was involved in designing, developing and testing various functionalities for [Amdocs](https://www.amdocs.com/) Billing Ensemble using C, C++, UNIX, LINUX, SQL, and Shell Scripting.

I am interested in developing and utilizing computational tools and machine learning algorithms to study, and understand complex human/biological/technical systems, processes.
